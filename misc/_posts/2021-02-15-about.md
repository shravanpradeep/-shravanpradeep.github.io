# About this site

This website is adapted from an excellent open-source template from the [Wadhwa Lab](https://wadhwalab.com/){:target="_blank"}. The source code is available in this [Github repository](https://github.com/navishwadhwa/navishwadhwa.github.io){:target="_blank"}. You will need [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com){:target="_blank"} to build the site, and you can host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. Instructions on how to update the content of the site and make other changed can be found in the file instructions.md.
