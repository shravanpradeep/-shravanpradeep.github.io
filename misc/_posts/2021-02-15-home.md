Shravan is a postdoctoral researcher working with [Doug Jerolmack](https://earth.sas.upenn.edu/people/douglas-j-jerolmack){:target="_blank"} ([Penn Soft Earth Dynamics Lab](https://pennsed.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and [Paulo Arratia](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/paulo-e-arratia/){:target="_blank"} ([Penn Complex Fluids Lab](https://arratia.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) at the University of Pennsylvania. Shravan's research interests lie in the <i>Water-Energy-Food Nexus</i>, where he aims to establish fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships in natural geomaterials to develop novel earth-inspired architected matter, accelerate the development of sustainable manufacturing, and establish a circular economy.
