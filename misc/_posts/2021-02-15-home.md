Shravan is a postdoctoral researcher working with [Doug Jerolmack](https://earth.sas.upenn.edu/people/douglas-j-jerolmack){:target="_blank"} ([Penn Soft Earth Dynamics Lab](https://pennsed.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) and [Paulo Arratia](https://directory.seas.upenn.edu/paulo-e-arratia/){:target="_blank"} ([Penn Complex Fluids Lab](https://arratia.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}) at the University of Pennsylvania. Shravan's research interests lie in the "Water-Energy-Food Nexus", where he aims to: (a) replace materials derived from hydrocarbon-based feedstocks to establish a circular economy; and (b) accelerate technologies in climate-resilient and precision agriculture. Shravan employs a <i>materials geomimicry</i> approach, which aims at the synthetic reconstitution of hierarchical soil structures, by deconstructing the multiscale mechanics of natural earth materials, using laboratory analogs. This <i>convergent</i> scientific approach sits at the intersection of soft particulate rheo-tribology, colloid and surface science, materials geochemistry, soft-living matter interactions, non-linear dynamics, and experimental "big data".
