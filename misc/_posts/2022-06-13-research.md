Climate change has exacerbated extreme weather events, which result in huge loss of human life and infrastructure. As the frequency of <i>once-in-a-century</i> catastrophies grow, the top soil of the earth becomes more vulnerable to extreme forcing conditions.   

From a materials engineering perspective, earth's surface is composed of diverse array of fluid-particulate mixtures, with its constituent particles ranging in length scales spanning four orders of magnitude. Moreover, the particles themselves are extremely complex in nature exhibiting size polydispersity, varied fluid-particle interations, and inherent particle moduli. Macroscopic failure of earth occurs as a results of system-spanning percolations of local collective reorganization of these diverse constituent materials during a natural event - a classic soft matter property. My research is focused on the intersection of soft materials and environment to engineer desired mechanical properties in soil suspension mixtures. 
# Current research
The main research goal is to identify current challenges in geophysics and apply concepts from soft matter physics to solve them. I employ rheometry (plate, couette, and inclined plane) and optical (microscopy and scattering) techniques to probe and study the following research questions in the area of soft earth geophysics: 

* Can dense suspension rheology help predict mudslides better?

* What are the various modes of subaqueous sediments collapse in ocean floors?  

* What rheological state diagrams define model mud suspension flow under steady shear? 

# Past research
My past research was focussed on trying to elucidate the effects of colloidal anisotropy on the linear and non-linear rheological properties of dense suspensions. The aim was to understand the difference in the structure-property relationship in suspensions that comprise of colloidal particles with varying surface roughness. Using stress-controlled rheometry, confocal microscopy, and concepts from granular physics, I studied three important questions in area of dense colloidal suspensions.

* When do colloidal particles <i>contact</i> in dense suspensions? 

* What inherent property makes "Oobleck fluids" shear thicken?

* Can we make engineer colloidal particles to enhance "solid-like" properties in dense suspensions?
