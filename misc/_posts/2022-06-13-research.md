Climate change has exacerbated extreme weather events. They result in huge loss to human life and infrastructure. As the frequency of <i>once-in-a-century</i> catastrophies grow, the top soil of the earth becomes more vulnerable to extreme forcing conditions.   

How can we study the flow and failure of soil material?

From a materials perspective, earth's surface is composed of heterogenous materials - with its constituents ranging from length scales spanning four orders of magnitude. The consituents of soil are extremely complex in nature with size polydispersity, varying fluid-particle interations, and inherent particle "squishiness". Macroscopic failure of earth is a result of collective reorganization of these diverse constituent materials due to external disturbances (natural forcing the case of top soil) - a classic soft material property. My research is focused on bridging the gap between soft matter physics and soil science to engineer mechanical properties in soil suspension mixtures. 
# Current research
The main research goal is to identify current challenges in geophysics and apply concepts from soft matter physics to solve them. I employ rheometry (plate, couette, and inclined plane) and optical (microscopy and scattering) techniques to probe and study the following research questions in the upcoming area of soft earth geophysics: 

* Can dense suspension rheology help predict mudslides?

* Why do sediments collapse the way it does in ocean floors?  

* What is the rheological phase space of a model mud suspension? 

# Past research
My past research was focussed on trying to elucidate the effects of colloidal anisotropy on the linear and non-linear rheological properties of dense suspensions. The aim was to understand the difference in the structure-property relationship in suspensions that comprise of colloidal particles with varying surface roughness. Using stress-controlled rheometry, confocal microscopy, and concepts from granular physics, I studied three important questions in area of dense colloidal suspensions.

* When do colloidal particles <i>contact</i> in dense suspensions? 

* What inherent property makes "Oobleck fluids" shear thicken?

* Can we make suspensions "solid-like" properties?
