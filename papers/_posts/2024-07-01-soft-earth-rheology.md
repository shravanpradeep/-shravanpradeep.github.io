# Abstract 

When wet soil becomes fully saturated by intense rainfall, or is shaken by an earthquake, it may fluidize catastrophically. Sand-rich slurries are treated as granular suspensions, where the failure is related to an unjamming transition. Mud flows are modeled as gels, where yielding and shear-thinning behaviors arise from inter-particle attraction and clustering. Here we show that the full range of complex flow behaviors previously reported for natural debris flows can be reproduced with three ingredients: water, silica sand, and kaolin clay. Going from sand-rich to clay-rich suspensions, we observe continuous transition from brittle to ductile yielding. We propose a general constitutive relation for soil suspensions, with a particle rearrangement time that is controlled by yield stress and jamming distance. Our experimental results are supported by models for amorphous solids, suggesting that the paradigm of non-equilibrium phase transitions can help us understand and predict the complex behaviors of Soft Earth suspensions.
