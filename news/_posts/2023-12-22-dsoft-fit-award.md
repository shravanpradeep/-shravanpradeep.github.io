I received the <b>Future Investigator Travel (FIT) Award</b> from the APS Division of Soft Matter (DSOFT). The travel grant partially covered the funding to present soft matter talk titled "â€œRheological fingerprints of non-inertial debris flows" at the Annual Meeting of the APS Divison of Fluid Dynamics (Washington DC, November 19-21, 2023).
